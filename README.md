# marvellist

##Description
Marvellist is a web app that I built (solo) with Sinatra in 2 days as my "beautiful, meaningful" project at Dev Bootcamp Chicago. I am a big fan of comic books, and I am thrilled with my Marvel Unlimited subscription, except that it is not very good at letting me find specific titles or at keeping track of where I'm at in my reading order. Building an app to help me and other readers manage our comic consumption is something I've been wanting to do for a long time. Even though this project isn't quite what I want it to be, I think it's cool I was able to get this far in two days only a few months after starting to learn to code. I look forward to turning this first draft into a more useful and user-friendly final product.

##Installation
(I'm holding off on deploying Marvellist to a permanent home on Heroku or Digital Ocean until I've migrated the app to a Rails framework and made some changes to the database, so for now, the app only exists locally.)

* Clone the repo.
* Run 'bundle install'.
* Run 'be shotgun'.
* In your browser, open localhost:9393
